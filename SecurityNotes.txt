Cross site Scripting 
SQL Injection
Broken Authentication and session management
Insecure Direct Object References
Cross Site Request Forgery (To solve this basically Captcha)
Security Misconfiguration (listing files, default logins)
Insecure Cryptographic Storage (ENCRYPT SENSITIVE DATA LIKE PAYMENT METHODS ECC.)
Failure to restrict URL Access (Self explainatory, we just have to check if access was given for some important urls (like admin page ecc.))
Insufficient Transport Layer Protection (JUST USE HTTPS ONLY AND JUST THAT)
Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
